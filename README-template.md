## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
 - Grid is defines the page structure with 2D layouts
 - Flexbox is ideal for aligning items within a component
 - Though they are strong indiviually, if the project calls for it, it's okay to combine them together.
