## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
 - To utilize the QA checklist that my boot camp taught us, the  HTML/CSS validator immediately caught my invalid code which would have saved me some valuable refactoring time 
 - Classes= styling flexibility and can be applied to multiple elements; IDs= reserved for unique identification and targeted scripting in JS & CSS  
 - When styling buttons or links, do not use width or height but padding (in em) 
 - Padding affects the space inside an element; margin affects the outside of an element
 - The basic building blocks on how to use CSS grid

### Useful resources

- [gridbyexample](https://gridbyexample.com/) - amazing site by Rachel Andrew that laid out in b&w (no pun intended) the layout for the grid 
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - my go-to AI that helps explain the "why" behind the notes I receive from the code review 
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) -  my go-to for when I need to extract color
- [Responsive Test Tool](https://responsivetesttool.com/) -  another go-to that ensures the design is responsive across multiple screens
